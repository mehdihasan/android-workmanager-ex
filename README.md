WorkManager Example
===================================

At I/O 2018 Google annouced [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com//jetpack/),
a collection of libraries, tools and architectural guidance to accelerate and simplify the
development of great Android apps. One of those libraries is the
[WorkManager library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/).
The WorkManager library provides a unified API for deferrable one-off or recurring background tasks
that need guaranteed execution. You can learn more by reading the
[WorkManager Guide](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager/), the
[WorkManager Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/work/package-summary)
or doing the
[WorkManager Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-workmanager).
